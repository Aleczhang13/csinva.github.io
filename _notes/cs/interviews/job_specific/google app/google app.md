# Additional skills
Is there additional information about your technical abilities that could help us match you to a project? e.g., Are you proficient in multiple programming languages? Have you received awards, built an exciting system or application, acted as a project lead in your coursework, made open source contributions or participated in major programming projects?

	Over time I've worked on several projects picking up a diverse skill set.  I am strongest in Java and Matlab, but I also have experience with Android, C++, Python, Scala, Web Basics, AngularJS, and am now very quick at picking up new languages.  I learned how to read large programs and collaborate with tools such as Git, Jira, and confluence through a couple of large projects.  First, I worked on a very large-scale web application that interfaced with different mapping APIs. Later, I contributed to a large program based on the mllib machine learning framework.  From all these large projects I learned to understand large code bases I hadn't written and how to parallelize massive computations.
	I've also done multiple guided research projects.  These have ranged from increasing the storage capacity of QR codes to simulating the backpropagation of neurons to simulating networks of neurons.  From these projects I learned to plan long-term solutions and properly document a programming project.  These projects supplemented my work in class for which I also had to do individual projects such as creating games in java and android.  Finally, I have explored these interests in outside platforms such as the International Collegiate Programming Contest and nearby hackathons.

# Additional preferences
Is there anything else you would like us to know about your preferences? e.g., What kind of projects excite you? Do you have a favorite Google product or know of a specific Google team that might be a good fit for your interests? Is there an area/discipline that you really want to learn? (2000 chars max)

	I have greatly enjoyed the things I have done in the past, but am also excited to explore as many new things as possible.  In general, I have two major interests that I would like to explore.  The first is handling large data.  This includes things like efficiently storing and retrieving data sets and then being able to characterize them with some kind of statistical analysis.  I particularly liked the machine learning approach to statistics I have been exposed to, as it is an interesting way to extract meaningful data from large training sets and do something useful it.  As a math major, I've developed a bunch of skills for analyzing numbers and I like being able to put these to use.  
	Secondly, I like developing applications that look nice and are fun to use.  My early exposure to frontend web development and android development piqued my interest in helping to develop sleek applications that are cool to play with.  I enjoyed developing cool graphics and GUI's for the java and android games I had to create for my classes.  I would be especially interested in helping to develop an application that I could visually see become nicer to use because of my contributions.

# If you have picked one, provide a short summary of your thesis topic or primary research focus. (2000 chars max)

	My research focus was on implementing a machine learning algorithm to help segement images of neurons.  Recently, scientists have begun creating maps of neural connections in the brain known as connectomes. However, brain imaging results in a massive amount of data which requires computers to segment them to identify distinct neurons in the images.  My focus was to use machine learning to do this image segmentation.  The base of the algorithm was a well-known ML algorithm known as random forests.  I helped to parallelize this algorithm using Apache Spark and then add a newly developed algorithm known as MALIS to it.  MALIS is an algorithm that takes advantage of the way neuron images look to do better segmentation than a normal computer vision algorithm. By the end of this past summer, the algorithm's performance was reasonable, but not yet sufficient for general use.  The algorithm and its parameters are still continuing to be tuned in order to provide better neuron segmentations.
