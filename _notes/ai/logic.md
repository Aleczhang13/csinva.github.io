# logical agents - 7.1-7.7 (omitting 7.5.2)

- *knowledge-based agents* - intelligence is based on *reasoning* that operates on internal *representations of knowledge*
- 3 steps: given a percept, the agent 
  1. adds the percept to its knowledge base
  2. asks the knowledge base for the best action
  3. tells the knowledge base that it has taken that action
- *declarative* approach - tell sentences until agent knows how to operate
- *procedural* approach - encodes desired behaviors as program code
  - ex. Wumpus World
- logical *entailment* between senteces
  - B follows logically from A (A implies B)
  - $A \vDash B$
- *model checking* - try everything to see if A $\implies$ B
  - this is *sound* = *truth-preserving*
  - *complete* - can derive any sentence that is entailed
- *grounding* - connection between logic and real environment (usually sensors)
- inference
  - TT-ENTAILS - recursively enumerate all sentences - check if a query is in the table
- theorem properties
  - *satisfiable* - true under some model
  - *validity* - *tautalogy* - true under all models
  - *monotonicity* - set of implications can only increase as info is added to the knowledge base
    - if $KB \implies A$ then $KB \land B \implies A$

# theorem proving

- *resolution rule* - resolves different rules with each other - leads to complete inference procedure
- *CNF* - *conjunctive normal form* - conjunction of clauses 
  - anything can be expressed as this
- *skip this* - resolution algorithm: check if $KB \implies A$ so check if $KB \land -A$
  - keep adding clauses until 
    1. nothing can be added
    2. get empty clause so $KB \implies Aâ€‹$
  - *ground resolution thm* - if a set of clauses is unsatisfiable, then the resolution closure of those clauses contains the empty clause
    - *resolution closure* - set of all clauses derivable by repeated application of resolution rule
- restricted knowledge bases
  - *horn clause* - at most one positive
    - *definite clause* - disjunction of literals with exactly one positive
    - *goal clause* - no positive
    - benefits
      - easy to understand
      - forward-chaining / backward-chaining are applicable
      - deciding entailment is linear in size(KB)
  - forward/backward chaining
    - checks if q is entailed by KB of definite clauses
      - keep adding until query is added or nothing else can be added
    - backward chaining works backwards from the query
- checking satisfiability
  - complete backtracking
    - *davis-putnam* algorithm = *DPLL* - like TT-entails with 3 improvements
      1. early termination
      2. pure symbol heuristic - *pure symbol* appears with same sign in all clauses
      3. unit clause heuristic - clause with just on eliteral or one literal not already assigned false
    - other improvements (similar to search)
      1. component analysis
      2. variable and value ordering
      3. intelligent backtracking
      4. random restarts
      5. clever indexing
  - local search
    - evaluation function can just count number of unsatisfied clauses (MIN-CONFLICTS algorithm for CSPs)
    - WALKSAT - randomly chooses between flipping based on MIN-CONFLICTS and randomly
      - runs forever if no soln
  - *underconstrained* problems are easy to find solns
  - *satisfiability threshold conjecture* - for random clauses, probability of satisfiability goes to 0 or 1 based on ratio of clauses to symbols
    - hardest problems are at the threshold
    - state variables that change over time also called *fluents*
      - can index these by time
  - *effect axioms* - specify the effect of an action at the next time step
  - *frame axioms* - assert that all propositions remain the same
  - *succesor-state axiom*: $F^{t+1} \iff  ActionCausesF^t \lor (F^t \land -ActionCausesNotF^t )$
- keeping track of *belief state*
  - can just use 1-CNF
    - 1-CNF includes all states that are in fact possible given the full percept history
    - *conservative approximation*
- *SATPLAN* - how to make plans for future actions that solve the goal by propositional inference
  - must add *precondition axioms* - states that action occurrence requires preconditions to be satisfied
  - *action exclusion axioms* - one action at a time

# first-order logic - 8.1-8.3.3

- declarative language - semantics based on a truth relation between sentences and possible worlds
  - has *compositionality* - meaning decomposes
- *Sapir-Whorf hypothesis* - understanding of the world is influenced by the language we speak
- 3 elements
  1. objects
  2. relations
    - functions - only one value for given input
- first-order logic assumes more about the world than propositional logic
  - *epistemological commitments* - the possible states of knowledge that a logic allows with respect to each fact
  - *higher-order logic* - views relations and functions as objects in themselves
- first-order consists of symbols
  1. *constant symbols* - stand for objects
  2. *predicate symbols* - stand for relations
  3. *function symbols* - stand for functions
  - *arity* - fixes number of args
  - *term* - logical expresision tha refers to an object'
  - *atomic sentence* - formed from a predicate symbol optionally followed by a parenthesized list of terms
    - true if relation holds among objects referred to by the args
  - $\forall, \exists$, etc.
  - *interpretation* - specifies exactly which objects, relations and functions are referred to by the symbols

# inference in first-order logic - 9.1-9.4

- *propositionalization* - can convert first-order logic to propositional logic and do propositional inference
  - *universal instantiation* - we can infer any sentence obtained by substituting a ground term for the variable
    - replace "forall x" with a specific x
  - *existential instantiation* - variable is replaced by a new constant symbol
    - replace "there exists x" with a specific x
    - *Skolem constant* - new name of constant
  - only need finite subset of propositionalized KB - can stop nested functions at some depth
    - *semidecidable* - algorithms exist that say yes to every entailed sentence, but no algorithm exists that also says no to every nonentailed sentence
- *generalized modus ponens*
- *unification* - finding substitutions that make different logical expressions look identical
  - UNIFY(Knows(John,x), Knows(x,Elizabeth)) = fail .
    - use different x's - *standardizing apart*
    - want most general uniier
  - need *occur check* - S(x) can't unify with S(S(x))
- storage and retrieval
  - STORE(s) - stores a sentence s into the KB
  - FETCH(q) - returns all unifiers such that the query q unifies with some sentence in the KB
    - only try to unfity reasonable facts using *indexing*
    - query such as Employs(IBM, Richard)
    - all possible unifying queries form *subsumption lattice*
- forward chaining
  - *first-order definite clauses* - disjunctions of literals of which exactly one is positive (could also be implication whose consequent is a single positive literal)
  - *Datalog* - language restricted to first-order definite clauses with no function symbols
  - simple forward-chaining: FOL-FC-ASK
    1. *pattern matching* is expensive
    2. rechecks every rule
    3. generates irrelevant facts
  - efficient forward chaining (solns to above problems)
    1. *conjuct odering* problem - find an ordering to solve the conjuncts of the rule premise so the total cost is minimized
      - requires heuristics (ex. *minimum-remaining-values*)
    2. incremental forward chaining - ignore redundant rules
      - every new fact inferred on iteration t must be derived from at least one new fact inferred on iteration t-1
      - *rete* algorithm was first to do this
    3. irrelevant facts can be ignored by backward chaining
      - could also use *deductive database* to keep track of relevant variables
- backward-chaining
  - simple backward-chaining: FOL-BC-ASK
    - is a *generator* - returns multiple times, each giving one possible result
  - logic programming: algorithm = logic + control
    - ex. *prolog*
    - a lot more here
    - can have parallelism
    - redudant inference / infinite loops because of repeated states and infinite paths
    - can use *memoization* (similar to the dynamic programming that forward-chaining does)
    - generally easier than converting it into FOLD
  - *constraint logic programming* - allows variables to be constrained rather than *bound*
    - allows for things with infinite solns
    - can use *metarules* to determine which conjuncts are tried first

# classical planning 10.1-10.2

- *planning* - devising a plan of action to achieve one's goals
- *Planning Domain Definition Language* (PDDL) - uses *factored representation* of world
- *closed-world* assumption - fluents that aren't present are false
- set of ground (variable-free) actions can be represented by a single *action schema*
  - like a method

## algorithms for planning as state-space search
