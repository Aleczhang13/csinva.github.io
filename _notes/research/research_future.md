# questions
- *problems that are solved, or soon will be*
	- how do single neurons compute?
	- what is the connectome of a small nervous system, like that of C. elegans (300 neurons)?
	- how can we image a live brain of 100,000 neurons at cellular and millisecond resolution?
		- hydra was completed
	- how does sensory transduction work?
- *problems that we should be able to solve in the next 50 years*
	- can we add senses to the brain?
		- like cochlear implant
		- like vibrations
	- how do circuits of neurons compute?
	- what is the complete connectome of the mouse brain (70e6 neurons)?
	- how can we image a live mouse brain at cellular and millisecond resolution?
	- what causes psychiatric and neurological illness?
	- how do learning and memory work?
		- short-term vs. long-term
		- declarative vs. non-declarative
		- encodes relationships between things not things themselves
		- memory retrieval
	- why do we sleep and dream?
		1. sleep is restorative (but then why high neural activity?)
		2. allows the brain to run simulations
		3. consolidating memories and forgetting
	- where is consciousness?
		- at this point, sounds and vision should line up (delayed appropriately)
	- how do we make decisions?
	- how does the brain represent abstract ideas?
	- what does neural baseline activity represent?
	- how does the brain solve timing?
		- moving eyes
		- blinking
		- hearing and vision time differences
	- how does sensorimotor learning build a model of the world?
- *problems that we should be able to solve, but who knows when*
	- how do brains simulate the future?
	- how does the mouse brain compute?
	- what is the complete connectome of the human brain (8e10 neurons)?
	- how can we image a live human brain at cellular and millisecond resolution?
	- how could we cure psychiatric and neurological diseases?
	- how could we make everybodyâ€™s brain function best?
	- brain and quantum?
		- some work in quantum neural nets
	- how is info coded in neural activity?
		- like measuring tansistors and guessing what computer is doing
		- neuron gets lots of inputs
	- do glial cells and other signaling molecules compute?
	- what is intelligence?
		- what is iq?
	- how do specialized systems integrate?
- *problems we may never solve*
	- what are emotions?
		- brain states that quickly assign values
		- in the amygdala
	- how does the human brain compute?
	- how can cognition be so flexible and generative?
	- how and why does conscious experience arise?
		- thing that flickers on when you wake up that was not there
		- evolutionary to manage all the different systems
- *meta-questions*
	- what counts as an explanation of how the brain works? (and which disciplines would be needed to provide it?)
	- how could we build a brain? (how do evolution and development do it?)
	- what are the different ways of understanding the brain? (what is function, algorithm, implementation?)

# brain-machine interfaces
- neuralink
	- surgeons won't want to put chips into people's brains
	- only for people with serious medical conditions right now
	- http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html
	
# RNA barcoding
- allows for tagging different neurons
	- can then optically get differences
	- also can sequence and get differences (http://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273%2816%2930421-4.pdf)

# brain transplant
- computational hypothesis of the mind

# tms
- temporary cure for autism
- can change people's minds
