I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley exploring the intersection of computer science and neuroscience (here's my <a color="#219AB3" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/cv_full.pdf"> CV</a>).


My research interests are in learning algorithms/statistical techniques for (1) neural decoding, (2) mapping the brain, and (3) computational models of learning.
