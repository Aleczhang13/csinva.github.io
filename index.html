I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley exploring the intersection of computer science and neuroscience (here's my <a color="#219AB3" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/cv_full.pdf"> CV</a>).

My research interests are in learning algorithms/statistical techniques for (1) computational neuroscience, (2) deep learning, and (3) interpretability.
