## About 

I'm currently at the University of Virginia. I will begin a PhD in computational neuroscience at UC Berkeley starting Fall 2017.

My research interests are in developing machine learning algorithms/statistical techniques for 1. neural decoding, 2. mapping the brain, and 3. developing computational models of learning.
